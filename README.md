CS353 - Term Project

In this project, it is intended to prepare a movie rental data store management system via a web application. It is basically designed to enable the customers rent their desired movies within limited period of time or buy them. The movies are sold or rented in Blu-ray and DVD format.

The system stores different kinds of copies of movies and detailed information about them such as directors, artists and genre of the movies. A customer can first become a member of the web application and makes a log in to the system with a password. Customers can search for the movies directly by movie names or can use the filtrations that the system supports if there is no specific movie in mind. The control mechanism of the system prevents the customers from buying or renting the movies according to the age limits. The customer can either rent the movies for period of time and pay the rent or buy the movies. The rental penalties in terms of extra money are applied to the customers with their late returns. The system provides the customers with the opportunity of requesting the order of movies which do not exist in the stocks of the system.
Data store management system keeps the records of all the customers and renting information.
By this way, the admin of the web application can maintain the control of the renting logs and perform the necessary actions on the customer accounts such as prohibiting the accounts which do not pay their debts. The system can also apply discounts and promotions on the movies, based on the renting history of the customers. 

Additionally, the system stores the data of the employees and the distributors. By this way, the admin keep track of the administration via the web application.
